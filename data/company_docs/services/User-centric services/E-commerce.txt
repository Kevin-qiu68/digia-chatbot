E-commerce
You should carefully map your customers' needs when you begin planning an online store that is easy to use and supports your customer throughout their buyer’s journey.

Put customer experience first in e-commerce
A delightfully smooth customer experience is an excellent way to stand out from the competition. This is equally true for online stores and brick-and-mortar stores.

In order for your online store to be a success, you need a clear user interface, comprehensive product information and easy purchase processes. But even more importantly, you must ensure that the background systems and purchase and supply chains are seamlessly integrated together.

Furthermore, don't make the mistake of thinking that a mobile app is just an additional service for your customers. Increasingly, mobile is the main purchasing channel. So, make sure it works flawlessly.

Remember, too, to ensure that your online store produces useful data for you to use in further development and marketing.


Charm your customer with up-to-date product information
Customers expect to find accurate and up-to-date information about the products they are comparing or intending to buy. The question is, will they wander off to a competitor's site in search of it?

Centralised product information management helps ensure that your store's product offering is always up to date. The smartest way to manage, enrich and classify product information is by using a PIM system. The platform acts as a central warehouse through which product information flows into other channels.

The information, maintained in one place, is simultaneously available for your own organisation and your customers. You can even use the same product information in marketing materials and catalogues as you have in your online store.
